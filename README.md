<h1>Hiking Trail Advisory</h1>

<p>[In progress] The Hiking Trail Advisory Application advises the user on which Washington State hikes are safe / interesting to do given the current weather conditions / snow levels. This application uses an HtmlAgilityPack web scraper to scrape hiking trail information from the WTA
website (https://www.wta.org/go-outside/hikes). Then it will use Apache Kafka Datastreaming to handle current / near-future weather information from a OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api).</p>
